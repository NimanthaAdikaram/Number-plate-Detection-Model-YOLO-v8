This project focuses on developing an optimized number plate detection model using YOLO v8, enhanced with libraries such as Ultralytics, OpenCV, Torch, and EasyOCR. The model detects number plates from vehicle images and transfers the data to a Firebase database, where it is compared with existing records to determine if the vehicle has previously entered the parking area. Additional 
libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy are utilized for data visualization and numerical operations, respectively. This integration ensures 
efficient and accurate vehicle identification and management within the parking area.
